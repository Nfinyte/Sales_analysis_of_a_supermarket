Tableau visualizations typically consist of charts, graphs, maps, or other visual elements that represent data points. These visualizations can be customized based on the specific data and analysis requirements.
<br><br>Here are some common elements you might find in a Tableau visualization:
<br><br>
        <ul>
<li>Filters and Parameters: Tableau allows users to filter data based on specific criteria or parameters. This feature enables interactive exploration of the data, allowing users to drill down into specific subsets of information.</li>

<li>Dimensions and Measures: In Tableau, data is typically categorized into dimensions and measures. Dimensions are qualitative attributes such as categories or labels, while measures are quantitative data that can be aggregated, such as sales figures or quantities.</li>

<li>Charts and Graphs: Tableau provides a wide range of chart types, including bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and more. These visual representations help to convey relationships, comparisons, trends, or distributions within the data.</li>

<li>Maps: Tableau also supports geographical data visualization, where you can plot data points on maps based on location. This is particularly useful for analyzing regional or spatial patterns.</li>

<li>Interactivity: One of Tableau's strengths is its interactive capabilities. Users can interact with the visualizations by hovering over data points for detailed information, filtering data dynamically, or even creating dashboards with multiple linked visualizations.</li>
          </ul><br>

To understand the specific details and insights conveyed by the visualization in the provided Tableau link, I recommend visiting the link directly and exploring the visualization yourself. You can interact with the filters, tooltips, or any other interactive features to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying data and analysis being presented.
